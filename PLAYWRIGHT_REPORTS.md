## Playwright Configuration

The generated tests include comprehensive Playwright configuration for reports:

### TypeScript Configuration
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default {
  reporter: [
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results.json' }],
    ['junit', { outputFile: 'test-results.xml' }]
  ],
  use: {
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    trace: 'on-first-retry'
  }
};
```

### JavaScript Configuration
```javascript
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  reporter: [
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results.json' }],
    ['junit', { outputFile: 'test-results.xml' }]
  ],
  use: {
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    trace: 'on-first-retry'
  }
};
```

## Running Tests with Reports

### Command Line
```bash
# Run tests with HTML report
npx playwright test --reporter=html

# Run tests with multiple reporters
npx playwright test --reporter=html,json,junit

# Open HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

### Generated Test Structure
```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ generated-test.spec.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright-report/          # HTML report
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ test-results.json          # JSON report
â””â”€â”€ test-results.xml           # JUnit report
```

## Report Types

### HTML Report
- **Interactive**: Click through test results
- **Visual**: Screenshots and videos embedded
- **Searchable**: Find specific tests quickly
- **Shareable**: Send links to team members

### JSON Report
- **Machine-readable**: Perfect for CI/CD integration
- **Structured**: Easy to parse programmatically
- **Complete**: All test data and metadata included

### JUnit Report
- **CI/CD Compatible**: Works with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.
- **Standard Format**: Widely supported by testing tools
- **XML Structure**: Easy to integrate with existing pipelines

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Playwright Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install
      - run: npx playwright test --reporter=html,junit
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

### Jenkins Integration
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npx playwright test --reporter=junit'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'test-results.xml'
                    publishHTML([
                        allowMissing: false,
                        alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
                        keepAll: true,
                        reportDir: 'playwright-report',
                        reportFiles: 'index.html',
                        reportName: 'Playwright Report'
                    ])
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Report Not Generated
- Ensure Playwright is properly installed
- Check that tests are actually running
- Verify file permissions for report directories

### Missing Artifacts
- Check Playwright configuration for screenshot/video settings
- Ensure tests are failing to trigger artifact capture
- Verify storage space and permissions

### Report Viewer Issues
- Refresh the extension if report doesn't load
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure test execution completed successfully

## Best Practices

1. **Always Generate Reports**: Include report configuration in all test projects
2. **Use Artifacts**: Enable screenshots and videos for debugging
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automated report generation in your pipeline
4. **Team Sharing**: Use HTML reports for team collaboration
5. **Debugging**: Use traces and videos to debug failing tests
